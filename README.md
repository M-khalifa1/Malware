# Malware
This is project for Information Security Course in my College.

                                    *****the benfits******* 
 
           -Learned how attackers think, i read and learned many of the techniques for attackers
           -Learned how I be security researcher and developer
           -Learned GUI in C Langauge and WIN 32 API which help me in reverse engineering for programs and malware.
           -Use threads to  handle GUI with Network Connection, also run keyloger at the same time.
           -Techniques to anti analysis and anti reverse.
       Note: not all of codes i wrote it from scratch, I reuse some of codes from internet. And some of it wrote from scratch.*****

                                   ******how to run this project******
            use MingGW to compile the Malware ,also use  notepad c++ as an editor or devc++ it is your dection that is in Windows OS,compile and run server.c file in linux OS. 
       write in CMD this command "gcc Malware.c -o activator.exe -lwsock32 -lwininet -lcomctl32 -mwindows -D_WIN32_IE=0x0401"
     Plaese make sure you are put your IP in server.c file and Malwrae.c file ,also must be put Malware.c file and KL.h File in the same directory.

                                    ****** Malware Features*****
                                       1-Persistance
                                       2-Keyloager
                                       3-hide into fake GUI(Social engineering)
                                       4-some of anti analysis Technique and reverse
                                       5-you can pack this malware to evade some of AV and to make analysis difficult on researchers (I didn't pack it due to always test the malware).
                                       6-excute Malicouc commands in CMD
                                       
                                      ***** Next Step if you want devlop this malware.***
                                             1-follow this course to make malware sophisticated you will learn how to evade AV using Shell code, process injection, ect. https://www.udemy.com/course/rootkit-and-stealth-software-development/
                                             2-this link is very useful you can learn from it devlop malware using C/win 32 API https://www.tenouk.com/cnwin32tutorials.html
                                             3-to learn anti-reverse read this tutorial  https://anti-debug.checkpoint.com/techniques/process-memory.html
